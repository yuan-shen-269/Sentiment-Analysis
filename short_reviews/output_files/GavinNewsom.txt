38 million Americans are out of a job. America is experiencing depression era unemployment. This isn’t a red or blue state issue. The federal government has a moral & ethical obligation to provide aid states & cities need to recover from this pandemic.

The Santa Susana toxic site should have been cleaned up long ago. Grateful for the partnership of @ENERGY — moving this project forward and helping ensure all those in the area are healthy and safe.

Great to join @Ava, @Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, @Jon_Huertas, and more today to talk about how the film and TV industries in CA have been impacted by #COVID19 -- and what a re-opening of the workplace could look like.

Tune in!

NEW: CA has 81,795 confirmed cases of #COVID19: +1.7% from yesterday. 3,073 of those are in hospitals: +1.2%. 1,076 of those are in the ICU: +0.0%.

When #COVID19 hit--Californians came together and met the moment. We stayed home. Worked hard to keep each other safe. Now, we’re starting to re-open our communities. But the fight against COVID-19 isn’t over. Let’s stay the course and stop the spread.

Great to join you all!

CA is allowing more counties to accelerate their re-opening process. This will be based on each county’s ability to increase testing, work with nursing homes, and stabilize their hospitalization and case rates. LEARN MORE:

NEW: Over the last 14 days, CA has seen: - 7.5% decline in hospitalizations. - 8.7% decline in the number of ICU patients statewide.

TUNE IN NOW for a #COVID19 update.
